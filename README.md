Legal-connect: Professional Law Practice Website
Project Overview
This project is a personal initiative to design and build a professional, user-centric website for a law practice. The goal is to create a comprehensive online presence that not only serves as a digital brochure but also provides interactive tools for clients to engage with the firm.

This project is part of my portfolio to showcase skills in full-stack web development, UI/UX design, and database integration.

Key Features
Interactive Home Page: A clean and professional design with clear calls to action.

Services & About Sections: Detailed information on the lawyer's expertise and professional history.

Case Submission Form (Planned): A secure, interactive form for potential clients to submit initial case details.

Case History Showcase (Planned): A dedicated section to display anonymized legal victories and client testimonials, building trust and credibility.

Real-time Database Integration: Utilizes Firebase Firestore for secure, real-time storage of case inquiries and client information.

Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling), JavaScript

Backend/Database: Firebase Firestore (for its scalability and real-time capabilities)

Version Control: Git & GitHub
